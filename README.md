## Weizenbaum Timeline+

This is my completion of the timeline challenge for Microsoft's AI for beginners course. 
I chose to create a timeline on Joseph Weizenbaum, the creator of one of the first ever chatbots, ELIZA.

Run this website locally:

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed.
2. Fork this repo and place it on your local machine in a folder.
3. Using the command line, CD (change directory) to the folder: `cd myTimeline`.
4. Use `http-server` to quickly start up a local server; from your code's folder run `npx http-server`.
